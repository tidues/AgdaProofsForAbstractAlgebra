# AgdaProofsForAbstractAlgebra
Attempt to use Agda to prove things in group, ring and field theory.

The main propositions to prove are all in the file starting with "HW". All others are auxiliary lemmas or theorems. Using agda can build a better understanding about how to use dependent typed language to construct proofs from ground up. That's also the reason why I wrote a lot of "basic things" myself while some of them have counterparts in the standard library.
